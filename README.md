# Floating-Point-ARM-Multiplier
A detailed and commented floating point multiplier code for a standard ARM architecture. It is not the most efficient but it has been made taking into account readability and understandability.

Code needed to function is in Main.S, to use it you will need to compile it, build it and debug it simulating a standard ARM architecture. 
For it you can use your preferred ARM IDE. I myself used eclipseARM, you will also need a script for the linker etc, the usual to debug ARM code.
