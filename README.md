# Floating-Point-ARM-Multiplier
A detailed and commented floating point multiplier code for a standard ARM architecture.

Code needed to function is in Main.S, to use it you will need to compile it, build it and run it. For it you can use your preferred
ARM IDE. I used eclipse, you will also need a script for the linker etc, the usual to debug ARM code.
